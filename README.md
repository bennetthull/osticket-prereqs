After creating a Windows 10 virtual machine in Azure, I used remote desktop to connect to it via its public IP address. From there, I enabled Internet Information Services (IIS) with CGI. I did this in Control Panel. This will act as a web server that will run on the computer.

From the oSTicket installation files folder (obtained by aggregating oSTicket documentation) I installed PHP Manager for IIS, the Rewrite Module, and created the directory C:\PHP. I then unzipped PHP 7.3.8 into the "C:\PHP" folder. After that I installed the C++ Redistributable file "VC_redist.x86.exe"

Next, I installed MySQL 5.5.62. This will be the database that will store the user accounts, ticketing information, etc. inside oSTicket. After that I opened IIS as an Admin, registered PHP from within IIS (PHP Manager -> C:\PHP\php-cgi.exe). Then I reloaded IIS (Open IIS, Stop and Start the server). I subsequently installed oSTicket from the oSTicket installation files folder. I did so by copying the upload folder into the web server folder. I loaded the osTicket site after that. I then enabled the missing extensions in IIS. Then I renamed ost-sampleconfig.php to ost-config.php and set full access permissions for "Everyone." I installed HeidiSQL, created a session with root/root, and created a database named osTicket. Then I finished the osTicket setup in the browser by entering the MySQL details and clicking "Install Now!"</p>
